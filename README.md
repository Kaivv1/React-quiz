This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Quiz with useReducer

## Available Scripts

In the project directory use:

### npm install

### npm run server
I used json-server to fake rest API, so this command needs to be used in order for the app to work.

### npm start
